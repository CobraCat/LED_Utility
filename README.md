# LED_Utility
This is an Excel workbook designed to generate text code for Arduino sketches.
That code will map a selected LED according to its RGB values,
map it according to any variables added,
map dynamic 'xy' positions of RGB selected LEDs or
may dynamic 'xy' postions and any LEDs which have been assigned variables.

There is no license on the application but due recognition of Kevin Darrah and
myself would be appreciated upon any modifications.

# Sketches.zip 
This file contains various sketches associated with the project, but there may be extras.
Check that the LED_Arduino.ino and LED_Arduino16.ino are set to Read-Only. You don't want
to overwrite those files.
